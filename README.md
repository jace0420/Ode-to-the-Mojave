# Preface
Welcome back to the Mojave! If this is your first time here... you may want to play vanilla New Vegas before jumping into this modlist. Still here? Alright. The Ode to the Mojave modlist is a mainly graphical overhaul of Fallout New Vegas with a large number of new gameplay additions as well.

New textures, lighting, and visuals are present as well as quests, weapons, armor, and more. I made this modlist to make the already great New Vegas even better and with more modern functions.

Now, you're probably eager to start downloading and begin playing this modlist but there are a few requirements that we need to put aside in order to begin.

**Note:** Currently, the modlist is in a very early state. There is still a lot of troubleshooting to do but at the moment it is in a mostly playable state aside from lag spikes and *rare* crashes. In the future I plan to add a lot more fixes and mods that will further make New Vegas an even greater game.

# Requirements / Pre - Wabbajack
When installing this list, it is good to practice using Mod Organizer and having a little bit of modding knowledge in any video game can be very useful. If this is your first time ever modding a game, I highly recommend trying on your own first and gradually try different things. Okay. Let's begin!

First, make sure that you have an absolutely clean installation of Fallout New Vegas. Go into your old directories and any documents to make sure there are no leftover files from previous modding journeys. You don't want those pesky critters ruining the experience.

Also, uninstalling through Steam does not always delete all the files, you may have to go into the 'xx:\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas' directory to see if there are any files remaining.

Next, make sure you have the latest ENB binaries from [the enbdev website](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_falloutnv.htm).
There is an ENB preset available with the Wabbajack installation but if you have any other ENB presets you would like to use that will work with '[FNV Realistic Wasteland Lighting](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/52037/)' feel free to download them if you know how to. I do not know if any presets will conflict with other mods however as I've only used the '[ENB of the Apocalypse]'(https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/50782) preset.

To run this modlist smoothly, I recommend having at least 4-6GB of VRAM and a decent high end graphics card. My PC's specs are as shown below:

* GPU: AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT
* 8GB VRAM
* 32GB RAM
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor

Finally, you're gonna need at least 60GB of free storage space on a seperate drive from your local one.
